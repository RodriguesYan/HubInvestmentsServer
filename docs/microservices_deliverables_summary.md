## 🏗️ Proposed Microservices Architecture

### Service Decomposition (6 Core Services)

| Service | Responsibility | Port | Database | Key APIs |
|---------|---------------|------|----------|----------|
| **User Management** | Authentication, JWT tokens, user profiles | 8081/50051 | hub_users_db | Login, ValidateToken, Register |
| **Market Data** | Asset data, real-time prices, WebSocket streaming | 8082/50052 | hub_market_db | GetMarketData, StreamPrices, ValidateSymbol |
| **Account Management** | Balance tracking, fund transfers, transactions | 8085/50055 | hub_accounts_db | GetBalance, ReserveFunds, TransferFunds |
| **Position & Portfolio** | Position management, portfolio aggregation, P&L | 8084/50054 | hub_portfolio_db | GetPositions, UpdatePosition, GetPortfolio |
| **Watchlist** | User watchlists, price alerts, notifications | 8086/50056 | hub_watchlist_db | ManageWatchlist, PriceAlerts, Notifications |
| **Order Management** | Order lifecycle, execution, risk management | 8083/50053 | hub_orders_db | SubmitOrder, ProcessOrder, CancelOrder |

### Communication Patterns

#### 🔄 **Synchronous (gRPC)**
- **User Authentication:** All services → User Management Service
- **Market Data Queries:** Order, Position, Watchlist → Market Data Service  
- **Balance Checks:** Order Service → Account Management Service
- **Portfolio Aggregation:** Portfolio Service → Position + Account Services

#### 📡 **Asynchronous (Events)**
- **Order Execution Events:** Order Service → Position + Account Services
- **Position Update Events:** Position Service → Portfolio aggregation
- **Price Update Events:** Market Data Service → Position + Watchlist Services
- **Balance Update Events:** Account Service → Portfolio aggregation

### Data Architecture

#### 🗄️ **Database Per Service Pattern**
- **Autonomous data ownership** - each service owns its database
- **Schema independence** - services can evolve data models independently  
- **No shared databases** - enforced data encapsulation
- **Event-driven consistency** - eventual consistency via events

#### 🔄 **Event Sourcing & CQRS**
- **Order Service:** Event sourcing for complete audit trail
- **Position Service:** CQRS for read/write optimization
- **Market Data Service:** Event streaming for real-time updates

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

- ✅ **Monitoring stack** deployment (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- ✅ **Message broker** configuration (RabbitMQ cluster)

### Phase 2: Core Business Services (Months 4-6)
- ✅ **Event-driven architecture** implementation
- ✅ **Database migration** with data integrity validation
- ✅ **Service extraction** for Account and Watchlist services
